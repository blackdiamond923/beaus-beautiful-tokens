  "description": "A token and portrait collection for Foundry VTT featuring over 1,600 dynamic ring tokens, nearly 800 classic red-ring tokens, and more than 3,800 matching portrait images. \n\nThere is some overlap between sets, but each group has been curated for versatility across campaigns. I originally made these for my own games, but I figured others might find them useful too.\n\nIf you have any questions, suggestions, or run into issues, feel free to reach out. Happy gaming."
