A  visual art collection for Foundry VTT, built to enhance your games with dynamic tokens and portraits.

---

## **About This Module**  
This is art I originally created for personal use across my games. I've packaged it here for others who might find it useful for their games.  

This module focuses **purely on visual assets** — no stat blocks, no lore writeups — just a clean, extensive library of ready-to-use tokens and portraits.

---

## **Contents**
- **1,600+ dynamic ring tokens** 
- **750+ red-ring tokens** 
- **2000+ matching portrait images**  
- Broad coverage across creature types, humanoids, beasts, monsters, and NPCs

---

## **Usage**  
- Tokens are organized for ease of browsing inside the File Picker.    
- Portrait images are matched to tokens where possible, making quick character creation easier.  
- [Token Variant Art](<https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-variants>)  Helps with swapping token images on the fly.

## **Notes**  
- This is a visual asset pack only. No mechanical or lore content is included.  
- There may be minor overlap between some dynamic ring tokens and red-ring variants.  
- I will update the module occasionally if I create large batches of new tokens.

---
## Sizing
- The dynamic rings when in Standard Fit mode  fit at a 1.2 scale and a subject texture of 1. Some fit with 2.4 and a subject scale of 2.

## **Questions or Feedback?**  
- Feel free to reach out if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions for improvement.
- I make these tokens using the PSD from [Foundry VTT](<https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1184176344276406292/1245876103113867294>) and [Photopea](<https://www.photopea.com/>)
- Here is a video showing my [Amateur Hour Way](<https://www.youtube.com/live/8lmlVwc85XA?si=B7kdDTIXSBXxAbC6>) of making tokens.
