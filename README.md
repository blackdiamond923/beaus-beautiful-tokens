# **Beau’s Beautiful Tokens**  

A  visual art collection for Foundry VTT, built to enhance your games with thousands of dynamic tokens and portraits.

---

## **About This Module**  
This is art I originally created for personal use across dozens of campaigns. I've packaged it here for others who might find it useful for their games or storytelling.  

This module focuses **purely on visual assets** — no stat blocks, no lore writeups — just a clean, extensive library of ready-to-use tokens and portraits.

---

## **Contents**
- **1,600+ dynamic ring tokens** 
- **800+ red-ring tokens** 
- **2000+ matching portrait images**  
- Minimal overlap between dynamic and red-ring styles  
- Broad coverage across creature types, humanoids, beasts, monsters, and NPCs

---

## **Usage**  
- Tokens are organized for ease of browsing inside the File Picker.    
- Portrait images are matched to tokens where possible, making quick character creation easier.  
- Ideal for DMs looking to quickly populate battle maps, generate NPCs, or customize their actors.
- Token Variant Art Helps with swapping token images easier.

## **Why I Made This**  
I had built up a  personal library of token art to and I realized others could hopefully benefit from this as well.

---

## **Notes**  
- This is a visual asset pack only. No mechanical or lore content is included.  
- There may be minor overlap between some dynamic ring tokens and red-ring variants.  
- I will update the module occasionally if I create large batches of new tokens.
